# Multiple Users Interacting With One Particle System

The title says it all really.

The project is an experiment in multiple user interaction and WebGL 2. [__The project is online here__](https://traces-cci.herokuapp.com) and a full project log and some other WebGL experiments can be found [__here__](https://joshmurr.github.io/cci-vis-env/).

A lightweight WebGL library was created alongside this project (which to be honest is _most_ of the project) and that [can be found here](http://www.github.com/joshmurr/webgl_boilerplate/).

This is a project made as part of the _Creative Computing MSc_ while studying at the [_Creative Computing Institute_](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute) in 2020.
